%% With this node we can collect a unique set of values from data_points based on a given field's value.
%%
%% This node is useful, if you have multiple similar data-streams - all share a field, that is unique to this data-stream -
%% that you want to condense into one, according to that field's value;
%% sort of an "un-group" function.
%%
%% Note: This node produces a completely new data_point
%% Given a field-name the node collects data_points using the value of this field to group and cache every incoming data.
%% Once the 'min_vals' count of unique values is reached in the internal buffer of the node, it starts emitting every change
%% within this set of values.
%% On output, the node will condense the collected data_points into one, where all the data_points' fields are grouped by the value
%% of the field that is given.
%% Note: The number of uniquely collected values will grow, but never shrink (at the moment).

%% Also note: The produced data_point can become very large, if the value of the specified field is ever changing, so that
%% the node will cache a lot of data and therefore may use a lot of memory, be aware of that !
